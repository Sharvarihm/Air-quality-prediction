# Air Quality Prediction (Classification & Regression with Forecasting)

This project predicts air quality using machine learning models and visualizes predictions with a Streamlit dashboard. It includes:

* A classification model using XGBoost and SMOTE
* A regression model using XGBoost for AQI value prediction
* A Streamlit dashboard for user interaction and forecasting

---

##  Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Imbalanced-learn
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Streamlit (for dashboard)

##  Features

* Cleaned and engineered air quality dataset
* Feature interaction and transformation
* XGBoost classification (Healthy, Unhealthy, Very Unhealthy)
* Regression for predicting exact AQI values
* Streamlit UI for forecasting future AQI categories
* Visualization of metrics and predictions

---

##  Dataset

* Name: `AirQualityData.csv`
* Fields include: PM2.5, PM10, NOx, CO, NO2, Temperature, Humidity, WindSpeed, Pressure, etc.
* Contains datetime stamps and AirQualityIndex (AQI)

> **Note**: If the full dataset cannot be published, included a sample

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### To Train and Evaluate Model (offline):

```bash
python prediction.py
```

This script will train the XGBoost classifier, print metrics, and show:

* Confusion matrix
* Feature importances

### To Launch the Streamlit App:

```bash
streamlit run forecast_app.py
```

This opens a browser-based dashboard with two modes:

* **AQI Classification**: Predict category
* **AQI Regression**: Predict AQI value + user input + forecasting

---

## ðŸ§ª Outputs

* `confusion_matrix.png`: Visualization of predicted vs actual categories
* `feature_importance.png`: Ranked feature importances
* Forecasted AQI categories for future days using most recent data
